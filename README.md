 • Aviyel is a platform for open source communities to build, activate and scale their communities.
 • Community Data Dashboard is a unified dashboard for the community leadership (maintainers, community managers) to track activity and engagement across multiple platforms like GitHub, Slack, twitter. This is similar to Orbit's
 • Rewards is a scalable no-code platform that helps incentivize community members for their contributions on GitHub, Slack and other platforms. Contributors can claim badges, mint them as soulbound NFTs or even get access to grants and other tangible rewards.
 • Workflows is an (upcoming) automation layer that helps community managers schedule messages, forms, interactions and automate engagement tracks on multiple platforms from a single interface. 
 • Engagement tools: A full fledged community events platform and collaborative markdown based content creation engine.
Aviyel is focussed now on creating a command centre for community managers to automate and drive their community engagement initiatives.

Following this, within the next 4-5 weeks we are releasing something that we internally call Request Board. This is an early version of a services and software marketplace for the projects and the community to provide services like support, consulting gigs, training, software subscriptions, hosted solutions etc to the businesses and users.
